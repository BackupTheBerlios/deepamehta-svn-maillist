+
+Installation
+============
+
+* Step 1: Unzip
+* Step 2: Install
+* Step 3: Deployment of the web frontends
+* Update an existing installation
+* Additional installation of the example applications
+
+Most of the processes that are dealt with in this and the following chapters can be executed by entering a &quot;run&quot;-command 
+in your terminal window.
+
+IMPORTANT: the &quot;run&quot;-command must be executed from within your DeepaMehta-home directory. 
+The DeepaMehta-home directory is the directory &quot;deepamehta&quot;, which will be created upon unzipping. 
+Use the &quot;cd&quot;-command to change into the DeepaMehta-home directory.
+
+IMPORTANT for Windows-users:
+
+=&gt; whenever you are asked to enter &quot;./run.sh&quot; Windows-users only have to enter &quot;run&quot;.
+
+Hint: To open a command-line window choose &quot;Execute...&quot; from the &quot;Start&quot;-menue, 
+enter &quot;cmd&quot; and press &quot;OK&quot;.
+
+
+Step 1: Unzip
+-------------
+
+The DeepaMehta distribution consists of the file &quot;deepamehta-2.0b8.zip&quot;.
+Unzip it into your applications directory, e.g.:
+
+    * Windows:     C:\Applications\
+    * Linux:       /home/you/
+    * Mac OS X:    /Macintosh HD/Applications/
+
+During unzipping the directory &quot;deepamehta&quot; will be created.
+
+
+Step 2: Installation
+--------------------
+
+To start the DeepaMehta installation enter the following command:
+
+    ./run.sh install
+
+First of all the DeepaMehta installation will be set up, in respect of 4 aspects:
+- Will the DeepaMehta web frontends be needed? (Tomcat required)
+- Which database shall be used by DeepaMehta? (the provided HSQL or MySQL)?
+- Which network port shall be accepted by the DeepaMehta server for client connections?
+- Which example applications shall be installed?
+
+Therfore a few questions will be asked. The standard answers are provided in squared brackets 
+and can be chosen by hitting the &quot;Return&quot; key. 
+
+
+=&gt; Web frontends
+
+First of all you will be asked, if you want to use the DeepaMehta web frontends. 
+If &quot;Yes&quot; is your answer, you must state where your Tomcat home-directory is located at.
+
+    [input] Do you want to install the web frontends (Tomcat must already be installed)? (y, [n])
+
+    [input] Please enter the home directory of your Tomcat installation. [/usr/local/tomcat]
+
+=&gt; Database
+
+Then you will be asked into which database the DeepaMehta application shall put your data. 
+If the provided HSQL-database shall be used, simply hit &quot;Return&quot;.
+
+    [echo] Please select the DeepaMehta instance to be configured:
+    [echo]
+    [echo] * hsqldb-intern (Recommended for just using DeepaMehta.)
+    [echo] * mysql4 (Required for use with web frontends. MySQL 4 must already be installed.)
+    [echo] * mysql5 (Required for use with web frontends. MySQL 5 must already be installed.)
+    [echo]
+    [input] Currently set [hsqldb-intern]
+
+IMPORTANT: If the DeepaMehta web frontends and the graphical DeepaMehta user interface shall be used simultaneously on your 
+computer, MySQL must be used as a database. 
+MySQL is not provided with DeepaMehta and must be installed separately.
+
+Now you will be asked for the name of the database which is going to be created. Enter your desired name for the database or simply hit &quot;Return&quot;.
+
+    [input] Please enter the name of the database to be created: [DeepaMehta]
+
+=&gt; Network port
+
+Then you will be asked for the network port which shall be used by the DeepaMehta server to accept client connections. 
+This setting is important for client-server operation (see &quot;Networked&quot; in section &quot;Starting &amp; Quitting&quot;), 
+especially if several DeepaMehta instances are in use (see &quot;Setting up additional instances&quot; in section &quot;Administration&quot;). At the moment simply hit &quot;Return&quot;.
+
+    [input] Network port for this instance (when served by the DeepaMehta server): [7557]
+
+=&gt; Example applications
+
+Now you will be asked which of the provided example applications you would like to install. 
+If you do not want to deal with the example applications at the moment, simply hit &quot;Return&quot;. 
+DeepaMehta is fully functionable without all of the example applications. They can be installed later as described in
+section &quot;Additional installation of example applications&quot;.
+
+    [input] Do you want to install the example application 'kompetenzstern'
+            (Balanced Scorecard editor and report generator)? (y, [n])
+    [input] Do you want to install the example application 'messageboard'
+            (Graphical forum application and web frontend)? (y, [n])
+    [input] Do you want to install the example application 'ldap'
+            (LDAP-Client for browsing users and groups)? (y, [n])
+    [input] Do you want to install the example application 'movies'
+            (Demonstration of accessing external datasources)? (y, [n])
+
+If you are about to install the &quot;movies&quot; example now, you will be asked for the kind of database you want to use for it.
+
+    [echo] Please select the datasource to be used for the 'movies' example:
+    [echo]
+    [echo] * hsqldb-intern
+    [echo] * mysql4
+    [echo] * mysql5
+    [echo] * xml
+    [echo]
+    [input] currently set (default) [hsqldb-intern]
+
+If you selected &quot;hsqldb-intern&quot; you will be asked to enter a name for your movies database now.
+
+    [input] Please enter the name of your database: [Movies]
+
+If, at the beginning, you decided that you want to use the DeepaMehta web frontends as well (with Tomcat), 
+you will now be asked, which of the provided web frontends you would like to install:
+
+    [input] Do you want to install the example application 'dm-browser'
+            (Generic web frontend demo 1)? (y, [n])
+    [input] Do you want to install the example application 'dm-search'
+            (Generic web frontend demo 2)? (y, [n])
+    [input] Do you want to install the example application 'dm-topicmapviewer'
+            (Generic web based topicmap viewer)? (y, [n])
+    [input] Do you want to install the example application 'dm-web'
+            (Generic web frontend demo 3, recommendend)? (y, [n])
+
+At this point the configuration of the DeepaMehta installation is completed.
+
+=&gt; Installation
+
+You will be asked if you wish to start the installation now. During the installation the 
+DeepaMehta database will be built and the chosen example applications will be stored in it. 
+To continue with the installation simply hit &quot;Return&quot;.
+
+    [input] Do you want to initialize now? ([y], n)
+
+Once again your database settings will be shown. As soon as you hit &quot;Return&quot; the DeepaMehta database will be created and the chosen content will be stored in it. 
+
+    [echo] --- DeepaMehta Installation ---
+    [echo] You are about to create a database 'DeepaMehta' and a database user 'sa' (password '').
+    ...
+    [input] Continue?  ([y], n)
+
+If you have chosen the Movies example application in the configuration process and &quot;hsqldb-intern&quot; as your data source, 
+the Movies example database will now be created.
+
+    [echo] --- DeepaMehta Installation ---
+    [echo] You are about to create a database 'Movies' and an
+    [echo] user 'sa' (password '') with corresponding grants.
+    ...
+    [input] Continue?  ([y], n)
+
+If the installation was successful, &quot;BUILD SUCCESSFUL&quot; will be displayed.
+
+
+Step 3: Deployment of the web frontends
+---------------------------------------
+
+If you decided to use the DeepaMehta web frontends in the configuration process they will be deployed now under Tomcat. 
+To start deployment please enter the following command:
+
+    ./run.sh deploy
+
+If the deployment was successful, &quot;BUILD SUCCESSFUL&quot; will be displayed.
+
+IMPORTANT: if Tomcat was already running during the deployment process, Tomcat needs to be restarted now (even if Tomcats hot-deployment function is activated).
+
+
+Update an existing installation
+-------------------------------
+
+To update an existing older version of Deepamehta to version 2.0b8 without loosing any of the already stored data please proceed with the following 3 steps:
+
+=&gt; Updating of the files
+
+Unzip &quot;DeepaMehta 2.0b8.zip&quot;, as described above in section &quot;Installation&quot;, &quot;Step 1: Unzip&quot;. 
+Be carefull not to overwrite your existing DeepaMehta installation!
+
+If you already have custom icons, topicmap background images or documents embedded in DeepaMehta, you need to copy them
+into the corresponding directories of your new DeepaMehta 2.0b8 installation:
+
+    deepamehta/install/client/icons/
+    deepamehta/install/client/backgrounds/
+    deepamehta/install/client/documents/
+
+=&gt; Configuration of the database
+
+Now your old database needs to be introduced to the new DeepaMehta 2.0b8. Therefor enter the following command:
+
+    ./run.sh config
+
+You will be asked a few questions. The following procedure is about the same as the one described in the above section &quot;Installation&quot; in &quot;Step 2: Install&quot;. 
+The question about the web frontends can simply be answered by hitting &quot;Return&quot; at this point.
+
+When asked for the type of database enter &quot;mysql4&quot; or &quot;mysql5&quot;, depending on the version of your MySQL installation.
+
+    [echo] Please select the DeepaMehta instance to be configured:
+    [echo] 
+    [echo] * hsqldb-intern (Recommended for just using DeepaMehta.)
+    [echo] * mysql4 (Required for use with web frontends. MySQL 4 must already be installed.)
+    [echo] * mysql5 (Required for use with web frontends. MySQL 5 must already be installed.)
+    [echo] 
+    [input] Currently set [hsqldb-intern]
+
+Then you will be asked for the database host, the database root-user password, the database name, 
+the name of the database user as well as the database user password. 
+If, at that time, you made a DeepaMehta standard installation and did not assign a root-user password to your 
+MySQL-Installation simply answer all questions with &quot;Return&quot;.
+
+    [input] Please enter the host of your database: [127.0.0.1]
+
+    [extendedinput] Please enter the database root password:
+
+    [input] Please enter the name of the database to be created: [DeepaMehta]
+    
+    [input] Please enter the user to use: [dm]
+
+    [input] Please enter the password to use: [dm]
+
+Now questions about the network port and the example applications will be asked, which again can be answered by hitting &quot;Return&quot; at this point.
+
+As soon as the configuration is finished, &quot;BUILD SUCCESSFUL&quot; will be displayed.
+
+=&gt; Update the database
+
+Now patches need to be installed to update your current version of DeepaMehta to DeepaMehta 2.0b8. 
+The following table shows you which are the appropriate patches to update your version of DeepaMehta. 
+Apply all patches, beginning with the one for your current DeepaMehta version.
+
+    Your current          Use these Patches to update to
+    DeepaMehta version    DeepaMehta 2.0b8
+    ----------------------------------------------------
+    2.0b3                 cm-2.13.sql
+    2.0b4                 cm-2.14.sql
+    2.0b5                 cm-2.15.sql
+    2.0b6                 cm-2.16.sql
+    2.0b7                 cm-2.17.sql
+
+If your currently installed version is e.g. DeepaMehta 2.0b7, you only have to apply the patch &quot;cm-2.17.sql&quot;. 
+If your currently installed version is e.g. DeepaMehta 2.0b5, apply the patches 2.15, 2.16 and 2.17 (in the correct order).
+
+To input the data of a single patch enter the following command (the patch &quot;cm-2.17.sql&quot; will be used here):
+
+    ./run.sh patchdb -Dpatch=install/db/patches/cm-2.17.sql
+
+For security reasons you will be asked if you really want to apply that spezific patch, and the concerned database will be displayed. 
+To apply the chosen patch enter 'y' and press &quot;Return&quot;.
+
+    [echo] You are about to apply the patch install/db/patches/cm-2.17.sql to the database DeepaMehta (user 'dm', password 'dm').
+    ...
+    [input] Continue?  (y, n)
+
+As soon as the patch is applied &quot;BUILD SUCCESSFUL&quot; will be displayed. Repeat the command to apply additional patches.
+
+
+Additional installation of example applications
+-----------------------------------------------
+
+To install additional example applications enter the following command:
+
+    ./run.sh install
+
+You will be asked the questions which are described above in &quot;Step 2: Install&quot;. Choose the example applications you would like to install.
+
+If you are asked &quot;Do you want to initialize now?&quot; answer with 'y' or simply hit &quot;Return&quot;.
+
+    [input] Do you want to initialize now? ([y], n)
+
+When you are asked, if the database shall be created now, answer with 'n' or simply hit &quot;Return&quot;.
+
+    [echo] Initialize the DeepaMehta instance 'hsqldb-intern' now...
+    ...
+    [echo] --- DeepaMehta Installation ---
+    [echo] You are about to create a database 'DeepaMehta' and a database user 'sa' (password '').
+    ...
+    [input] Continue?  (y, [n])
+
+When the example applications have been installed successfully, &quot;BUILD SUCCESSFUL&quot; will be displayed.
+
+
+
+Starting &amp; Quitting
+===================
+
+* Single-place
+* Networked
+* Web frontends
+
+
+Single-place
+------------
+
+The easiest way to start DeepaMehta is as a single-place application. The single-place application is fully sufficient if you do not plan to get connected to other DeepaMehta users. (networked).
+
+=&gt; To start the single-place application enter the following command:
+
+    ./run.sh
+
+The DeepaMehta login dialog will be displayed. Enter &quot;root&quot; and hit &quot;Return&quot; 2 times (initially the DeepaMehta root-user does not have a password). 
+The DeepaMehta desktop will occur.
+
+To start a specific DeepaMehta instance set the &quot;dm.instance&quot; property with -D at the command line:
+
+    ./run.sh -Ddm.instance=myinstance
+
+Informations about DeepaMehta instances you will find in section &quot;Administration&quot;, &quot;Configure additional instances&quot; as well as in &quot;Define standard instance&quot;.
+
+=&gt; To quit DeepaMehta simply close the DeepaMehta window.
+
+Technical security advice: the monolithic DeepaMehta application has the DeepaMehta client and the server integrated into one single application, 
+where the communication takes place by direct method calls. No network port is needed.
+
+
+Networked
+---------
+
+The DeepaMehta client/server application enables different users to work together over a network.
+
+=&gt; To start the DeepaMehta server enter the following command:
+
+    ./run.sh dms
+
+To serve a specific DeepaMehta instance set the &quot;dm.instance&quot; properties to the desired instance at he command line:
+
+    ./run.sh dms -Ddm.instance=myinstance
+
+Informations about DeepaMehta instances can be found in section &quot;Administration&quot;, &quot;Configure additional instances&quot; and &quot;Determine standard instance&quot;.
+
+=&gt; To start the DeepaMehta client application and get connected to a local DeepaMehta server enter the following command:
+
+    ./run.sh dmc
+
+To connect to a specific DeepaMehta server set the &quot;dm.host&quot; and &quot;dm.port&quot; properties at the command line 
+(If no host is specified &quot;localhost&quot; will be used. If no port is specified the default port (7557) will be used):
+
+    ./run.sh dmc -Ddm.host=www.site.com -Ddm.port=7558
+
+The DeepaMehta login dialog will appear. Enter &quot;root&quot; and hit &quot;Return&quot; 2 times (the DeepaMehta root user does not have a password yet). 
+The DeepaMehta desktop will appear.
+
+=&gt; To start the DeepaMehta client applets resp. the signed client applets open the corresponding website in your web browser:
+
+    .../deepamehta/install/client/start.html
+    .../deepamehta/install/client/start-signed.html
+
+The client applet expects the DeepaMehta server to run on the same machine as the one the applet was loaded from. 
+The port used by the client applet to contact the server can be edited on the HTML-sites by entering its value in the  
+applet-parameter &quot;PORT&quot;. eingestellt werden. If no &quot;Port&quot;-parameter is available, the default port (7557) will be used.
+
+Technical security advice: The DeepaMehta clients communicate with the DeepaMehta server via TCP sockets. 
+The DeepaMehta server opens a dedicated TCP-port (it is port 7557 by default).
+
+
+Web frontends
+-------------
+
+6 different web frontends are provided with DeepaMehta. To start a web frontend enter the corresponding URL into your web browser:
+
+    <A HREF="http://localhost:8080/kompetenzstern/controller">http://localhost:8080/kompetenzstern/controller</A>
+    <A HREF="http://localhost:8080/messageboard/controller">http://localhost:8080/messageboard/controller</A>
+    <A HREF="http://localhost:8080/dm-browser/controller">http://localhost:8080/dm-browser/controller</A>
+    <A HREF="http://localhost:8080/dm-search/controller">http://localhost:8080/dm-search/controller</A>
+    <A HREF="http://localhost:8080/dm-topicmapviewer/controller">http://localhost:8080/dm-topicmapviewer/controller</A>
+    <A HREF="http://localhost:8080/dm-web/controller">http://localhost:8080/dm-web/controller</A>
+
+The web frontends can only be started if DeepaMehta has been configured correspondingly (see Section &quot;Installation&quot;, &quot;Step 2: Installation&quot;) 
+and the web frontends have been deployed (see Section &quot;Installation&quot;, &quot;Step 3: Deployment of web frontends&quot;). 
+Tomcat needs to be started already.
+
+
+
+Administration
+==============
+
+* Set the root password
+* Configure additional instances
+* Determine standard instance
+* Delete an instance
+* Controll Tomcat
+* Reset the database
+* Uninstall DeepaMehta
+
+
+Set the root password
+---------------------
+
+1) Start DeepaMehta (Single-place or networked) and log in as &quot;root&quot;.
+2) Choose the workspace &quot;Administration&quot; from the pulldown menue.
+3) Open the topicmap &quot;Users and Groups&quot; with a double-click.
+4) Click on the user &quot;root&quot;.
+5) Enter your desired password on the right side into the &quot;Password&quot; field.
+
+Setting up additional instances
+-------------------------------
+
+For some specific needs independent DeepaMehta instances can be created (e.g. one with &quot;real&quot; content and one for testing during development). 
+Each DeepaMehta instance has a separate corporate memory (content-memory). For each corporate memory an individual database system (e.g. HSQL or MySQL) can be used.
+
+To create a new DeepaMehta instance please enter the following command: 
+
+    ./run.sh newinstance
+
+First of all you will be asked to set the configuration for the new instance. If e.g. for the new instance 
+a HSQL-database shall be used, choose &quot;hsqldb-intern&quot;.
+
+    [echo] Please select the instance configuration the new instance is based on:
+    [echo] 
+    [echo] * hsqldb-intern
+    [echo] * mysql4
+    [echo] * mysql5
+    [echo] 
+    [input] Instance name: [hsqldb-intern]
+
+Then you will be asked to name the new instance. A good advice is to choose a name that speaks for itself, e.g. &quot;production&quot; or &quot;test&quot;.
+
+    [input] Please enter the new instance name: [hsqldb-intern2]
+
+Then the new instance will be configured and installed, like it is explained in the above section &quot;Installation&quot;, &quot;Step 2: Install&quot;. 
+When you are asked for the name of the database that is going to be created, all existing databases will be listet. 
+Enter a database name, that is not in the list yet.
+
+    [input] Please enter the name of your database: [DeepaMehta]
+
+Simply answer all other questions (concerning the web frontends and the example applications) with &quot;Return&quot;, 
+whereby the settings made so far will be transfered to the new instance 
+(Advice: these settings are not stored per single DeepaMehta instance but are stored globally).
+
+Now you will be asked if the new instance shall be installed now. Answer with yes by hitting &quot;Return&quot;.
+
+    [input] Do you want to initialize now? ([y], n)
+
+If the instance was set up succesfully &quot;BUILD SUCCESSFUL&quot; will be displayed. Zum Starten einer bestimmten DeepaMehta-Instanz siehe oben den Abschnitt &quot;Starten &amp; Beenden&quot; und den folgenden Punkt &quot;Standard-Instanz festlegen&quot;.
+
+
+Determine a standard instance
+-----------------------------
+
+A specific instance can be defined as standard instance. The standard instance is used if DeepaMehta gets started without stating an instance.
+
+To determine an instance enter the following command:
+
+    ./run.sh switchinstance
+
+The names of all existing instances will be listed and the current standard instance will be displayed. 
+Enter the name of the future standard instance and hit &quot;Return&quot;.
+
+    [echo] Please select the DeepaMehta instance to activate:
+    [echo] 
+    [echo] * hsqldb-intern
+    [echo] * myinstance
+    [echo] 
+    [input] Currently set [hsqldb-intern]
+
+
+Delete an instance
+------------------
+
+To delete an instance enter the following command, by setting the &quot;dm.instance&quot; properties at the command line with -D:
+
+    ./run.sh dropdb -Ddm.instance=myinstance
+
+For security reasons you will be asked if you really want to delete that instance. Enter 'y' and hit &quot;Return&quot; to delete that instance.
+
+    [echo] Uninstalling the DeepaMehta instance 'myinstance' now...
+    ...
+    [echo] You are about to delete the database 'DeepaMehta'.
+    ...
+    [input] Continue?  (y, n)
+
+
+Control Tomcat
+--------------
+
+=&gt; To start Tomcat enter the following command:
+
+    ./run.sh tomcat-start
+
+IMPORTANT: Tomcat must be started from the directory deepamehta/install/client/, otherwise the web frontends will not find neccessary files. 
+Please use the command stated above to start Tomcat, and not the mechanisms of your system environment (e.g. /etc/init.d under Linux).
+
+=&gt; To stop Tomcat enter the following command:
+
+    ./run.sh tomcat-stop
+
+=&gt; To view the Tomcat-diagnostics enter the following command:
+
+    ./run.sh tomcat-log
+
+Hint: the Tomcat-diagnostics can be read best if you enter the command in a separate terminal window, which should remain open during the whole session.
+
+
+Reset the database
+------------------
+
+
+Uninstall DeepaMehta
