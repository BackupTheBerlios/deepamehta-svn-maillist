Log:
1) Bug #14746 fixed (Client freezes for large search results)
IMPORTANT: the error still occurs for already existing large search results. In order to fix this, start the monolithic application and remove the large search results (more than 300 items) manually. From that moment the client/server application will work.
2) Prepared for release:
2a) integrated the patches cm-2.18.sql and cm-2.19.sql to cm.sql
2b) README files updated
